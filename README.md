# icecast-split

I once had my computer listen to internet radio, to play back later.

I didn't realize icecast means it intersperses (mostly title) metadata in the otherwise plain media stream, so I then had to parse it out.


And because it parses ot out the title anyway, I added a mode that splits on songs. Which is imperfect because radios fade songs (also because it doesn't even cut on the nearest media frame).
